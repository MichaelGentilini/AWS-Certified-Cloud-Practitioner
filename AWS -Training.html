            <li>
              The <strong>ASG</strong> starts by launching the desired number of EC2

            <strong> Why a Managed RDS?</strong>
            <li>
              With a managed <strong>RDS</strong> you can allocate or increase
              resources as you need then, on the fly (CPU, memory, storage)
            </li>
            <li>
              Forget about backups, OS patches and recovery
            </li>
            <li>
              Automate or manually backup for DB restore
            </li>
            <li>
              Achieve <em>HA(high availability)</em> with primary DB and a
              synchronous secondary DB; use read replicas to increase read scaling

            <li>
              Control who can access the DB with AWS IAM

            <br />
            <strong> Amazon RDS DB Instances</strong>
            <li>
              The DB instance is the building block of AWS RDS.
            </li>
            <li>A DB instance is just a database environment in the cloud</li>
            <li>
              Each DB instance runs a <em>DB Engine</em> and AWS supports MYSQL,
              MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server DB engines
            </li>
            <li>
              The DB engines differ in terms of features; the DB engine controls the
              DBs that it manages
            </li>
            <li>
              The <em>DB Instance class</em> determines the CPU and memory the DB
              will use
            </li>
            <li>
              When you select the storage for the DB, you can choose from:
              <ul>
                <li>Magnetic</li>
                <li>General Purpose (SSD)</li>
                <li>Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Each DB instance has min/max storage requirements; depends on the
              storage type and DB engine it supports

            <strong>Amazon RDS Security</strong>
    
            <li>
              RDS security is implemented through security groups; you can allow
              access to the DB by specifying IP address ranges or Amazon EC2
              instances
            </li>
            <li>
              Three types of security groups can be used:

                <li>DB security group, control access to a DB that is not a VPC</li>
                <li>
                  VPC security group controls acces to a DB instance inside a VPC
                </li>
                <li>
                  Amazon EC2 security group controls access of an EC2 instance to
                  the DB
                </li>

            <strong>Fundamentals of Pricing</strong>
            <ul>
              for the vast majority of AWS services, the following impact the cost:
              compute, storage, and outbound data transfer
              <li>Compute is paid by the minute or hour</li>
              <li>Storage is paid on a per GB basis</li>
              <li>
                NO CHARGE for data transfer INBOUND, outbound is charged and
                aggregated on your bill per GB (AWS Data Transfer Out)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <strong>Start early with cost optimization</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You should start managing your costs from the beginning of your
                implementations start date; the complexity grows as your move
                forward and scale your project
              </li>
              <li>
                it's easiest and recommended to put cost visibility and control
                mechanisms in place before the environment becomes too large and
                complex

                With AWS you pay for exactly what you need with no minimum

              <li>You can choose to save money through a reservation model</li>
              <li>
                Using a pay-as-you-go model, procurement complexity is reduced which
                enables your business to be fully elastic
              </li>
              <li>
                You don't pay for services that are not running (cost efficiency)

            <li>
              AWS uses redundant and multi-layer controls, continuous validation and
              testing, and built-in automation, that helps monitor and keep
              customers safe and secure
            </li>
            <li>
              The same level of automation and security is contained and replicated
              in any AWS DC(data center) (AZ)
            </li>
            <li>
              With AWS, you get a resilient, fault-tolerant architecture, designed
              for security, able to satisfy the requirements of even the most
              security-sensitive customers

            <li>Monitors connections forwarded to your web application</li>
            <li>
              A WAF is a protocol 7 defense (<a

                >OSI Model</a
              >) and is not designed to defend against all types of attacks
            </li>
            <li>
              As opposed to a typical newtwork firewall, WAFs understand traffic
              from the application perspective; with WAF you can monitor HTTP and
              HTTPS traffic, which is more than just TCP protocol and 80/443 port
              numbers
            </li>
            <li>
              WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as
              cross-site forgery, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and
              SQL injection
            </li>
            <li>
              This method of attack mitigation is usually part of a suite of tools
              which together create a holistic defense against a range of attack
              vectors
            </li>
            <li>
              Deploying a WAF in front of a web application literally means
              installing a shield between the web application and the Internet users

            <strong>Introduction</strong>
            <li>
              Migrating applications to AWS, even without significant changes (<em
                >"lift and shift"</em
              >), provides organizations the benefits of a secured and
              cost-efficient infrastructure
            </li>
            <li>
              Architectures need to be changed and get updated, which will lead to
              immediate benefits like agility and elasticity, that are possible and
              available with cloud computing
            </li>
            <li>
              Following are the best practices that have emerged, as a result of
              cloud - traditional computing differences
            </li>
            <ul>
              <strong>IT Assets Become programmable Resources </strong>
              <li>
                In a traditional data center, resource provisioning is done by
                guessing and making assumptions on maximum peak load; this results
                in either idle expensive resources not being utilized or
                insufficient capacity to handle traffic
              </li>
              <li>
                This is totally different with Cloud Computing; use the right amount
                of capacity, dynamically scale up or down when needed, pay-as-you-go
                and only pay for what you use
              </li>
              <li>
                AWS services are up and running in minutes, you can use as much or
                little as needed
              </li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
            <ul>
              <strong>Global, Available and Unlimited Capacity</strong>
              <li>
                When you deploy your app in the cloud, several best practices should
                be followed: proximity to end users, compliance or data residency
                constraints, costs
              </li>
              <li>
                In order to achieve low latency for your application, you may want
                to use Amazon CloudFront CDN
              </li>
              <li>
                High availability and fault tolerance for your apps using AWS global
                infrastructure, deploy in multiple DCs
              </li>
              <li>With AWS there is virually unlimited capacity</li>

              <li>
                Using managed services from AWS, helps you lower operational

              </li>
              <li>
                Reducing risk for your project implementations is easy, as all AWS

            <h5>Architecture - Design Principles - Scalability</h5>
          </div>
    
          <ul class="text-left">
            <strong>Scalability Overview</strong>
            <li>
              Systems that are expected to grow over time need to be built on top of
              a scalable architecture
            </li>
            <li>
              Scalable architecture provides the ability to grow your environment
              when this is needed (additional users, traffic throughput)
            </li>
            <li>
              Cloud computing allows virually unlimited growth, but the underlying
              architecture must be designed to support this
            </li>
            <li>Scale either vertically or horizontally</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <strong>Scaling Vertically</strong>
            <li>
              Means <em> increasing the capacity</em> of your current server, as an
              example
            </li>
            <li>
              At some point you discover that your current server can no longer
              process the amount of data that is constantly increasing => you need
              to scale/grow
            </li>
            <li>
              For Example: you are running your website on an Amazon EC2 instance:
              a1.medium (1vCPU, 2GB RAM) and will migrate your EC2 instance to a
              more advanced options m5.24xlarg(96vCPU, 384GB RAM)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <strong>Scaling Horizontally</strong>
            <li>
              Means <em>increasing the number of resources</em> i.e. adding more EC2
              instances
            </li>
            <li>
              This is not always possible, depending on the underlying architecture,
              which can or cannot distribute traffic to multiple resources
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="text-left">
            <strong>Scaling Horizontally - Stateless Applications</strong>
            <li>
              Stateless vs Stateful
            </li>
            <li>
              Stateless applications do NOT store any data and the connections
              independent from one another
            </li>
            <li>
              A Stateless Application is an application that needs no knowledge of
              previous interactions and stores no session information; i.e. app
              provides the same response, to any user with the same input
            </li>
            <li>
              Stateless applications are a great candidate for horizontal scaling;
              simply add more EC2 instances in order to run the app and terminate
              the instances when no longer needed
            </li>
            <li>
              The easiest and most popular way to distribute traffic to a fleet of
              instances is using an Elastic Load Balancers ELB
            </li>
          </ul>
          <hr />
          <ul class="text-left">
            <strong>Scaling Horizontally - Stateless Components</strong>
            <li>
              Most applications need to maintain some kind of state information (web
              apps need to track whether a user is signed in)
            </li>
            <li>
              Some web applications use HTTP cookies to store data on the client
              side while other scenarios require storing larger files
            </li>
            <li>For the second option, Amazon S3 or EFS could be used</li>
            <li>
              There are cases when you cannot change all your components in your
              architecture to stateless
            </li>
            <li>
              Example: real-time multiplayer online gaming, users are connected to
              the same server (low latency and best experience this way)
            </li>
            <li>
              horizontal scaling can be achieved in this case also using
              <em>"session affinity"</em> - binding all connections from a specific
              user to only a single server
            </li>
          </ul>
          <hr />
          <ul class="text-left">
            <strong>Scaling Horizontally - Distributed Processing</strong>
            <li>This is similar to breaking a problem into smaller pieces</li>
            <li>
              When a single compute resource cannot process information, because
              it's too large, then the work will be distributed and split into
              fragments, to more instances
            </li>
            <li>
              This use case is common for Big Data scenarios (processing large
              volume data sets)
            </li>

          <ul class="text-left">
            <li>
              In traditional data center environments, you work with fixed resources
              or servers; this translates into high up-front costs and additional
              time leading to production
            </li>
            <li>
              Within AWS, you launch as many servers as you need, user them as along

            <li>
              <em>Configuration Drift </em> - configuration changes and software
              patches can be applied inconistently; which leads to differences in
              configurations (possibly untested) on your resources in the DC
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Immutable Infrastructures</em> - can solve the above issue;
              instead of patching and modifying intial configuration on your
              servers, just change the old server with the new one that new software
              packages applied

            <p>
              IT systems should ideally be designed in a way that reduces
              inter-dependencies. Your components need to be loosely coupled to
              avoid changes or failure in one of the components from affecting
              others.

            </li>
            <li>
              Using open-source communication interfaces (not vendor specific) leads

            <strong>Service Discovery</strong>
            <li>
              Implementing loose coupling means you will have a lot of services that
              need to either communicate with each other or other services in your
              environment
            </li>

              There needs to be a way to address, or call any service, in a unique

                <li>a form of virtualization for the operating system</li>
                <li>
                  Unlike a VM which provides hardware virtualization, a container
                  provides operating-system-level virtualization by abstracting the
                  “user space”. You’ll see what I mean as we unpack the term
                  container.
                </li>
                <li>
                  For all intent and purposes, containers look like a VM. For example,
                  they have private space for processing, can execute commands as
                  root, have a private network interface and IP address, allow custom
                  routes and iptable rules, can mount file systems, and etc.
